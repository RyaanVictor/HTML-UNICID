				<h3>Yeah! Yeah, yeah, shit, I live for the chase<br/>
				They wanna know how I'm livin' my life<br/>
				On a regular day, woah<br/>
				Wake up and pop me like two or three pills<br/>
				Man, I'm feelin' great, yeah<br/>
				Pick up my phone, I don't even scroll<br/>
				Just throw it away<br/>
				Get that shit out of my face, yeah<br/>
				I'm still alive<br/>
				Workin' overdrive, yeah<br/>
				Drinkin' on the job<br/>
				Because it ain't no nine to five, yeah<br/>
				Been up for too long<br/><br/>

				These other artists can't survive, yeah<br/>
				She said I'm too reckless<br/>
				I said: Baby, this is life, yeah<br/><br/>

				I live for the chase<br/>
				I live for the drugs<br/>
				I live for the money<br/>
				I live for the fame, yeah<br/>
				I live in the clouds<br/>
				I ain't comin' down<br/>
				Bitch, I'm gonna stay, yeah<br/>
				Do your research<br/>
				We don't ever make mistakes<br/><br/>

				Look death in the eyes like every day<br/>
				I live for the—<br/><br/>

				Damn, I'm covered in flames<br/>
				I don't need a fuckin' fire suit<br/>
				Bitch, I got fire runnin' through my veins, yeah<br/>
				Ever since we made devilish<br/>
				I been pryin' open heaven's gates, yeah<br/>
				Once I get in, I'ma burn every bridge<br/>
				Then I'm dippin' down the fire escape, yeah<br/>
				It’s in my DNA, grandma escaped<br/>
				Had to leave Africa<br/>
				Somehow she managed to fight her own fate<br/><br/>

				Evading militia, they wiped out the village<br/>
				But she got away<br/>
				Said: No, I don't take life for granted<br/>
				'Cause life is never guaranteed<br/><br/>

				I live for the chase<br/>
				I live for the drugs<br/>
				I live for the money<br/>
				I live for the fame, yeah<br/>
				I live in the clouds<br/>
				I ain't comin' down<br/>
				Bitch, I'm gonna stay, yeah<br/>
				Do your research<br/><br/>

				We don't ever make mistakes<br/>
				Look death in the eyes like every day<br/>
				I live for the chase<br/>
				I live for the drugs<br/>
				I live for the money<br/>
				I live for the fame<br/>
				I live in the clouds<br/>
				I ain't comin' down<br/>
				Bitch, I'm gonna stay, yeah<br/>
				Please just do your research<br/>
				We don't ever make mistakes<br/>
				Look death in the eye like every day<br/>
				I live for the—<br/><br/>

				Please stop playing catch up, this is not a race<br/>
				Please don't call for backup, this is not a game<br/>
				Put you in the dirt, you throw dirt on my fuckin' name<br/>
				Push start, hit reverse, I back up in that wraith<br/>
				Say I need it when I'm comin' down<br/>
				Smoke and mirrors shift, I'm bouncin' off the fucking ground<br/>
				Perky just kicked in, I feel like I'm evolvin'<br/>
				Broski got no trouble shootin', call that problem-solvin'<br/><br/>

				I live for the chase<br/>
				I live for the drugs<br/>
				I live for the money<br/>
				I live for the fame, yeah<br/>
				I live in the clouds<br/>
				I ain't comin' down<br/>
				Bitch, I'm gonna stay, yeah<br/>
				Do your research<br/>
				We don't ever make mistakes<br/>
				Look death in the eyes like every day<br/>
				I live for the—<br/><br/>

				I live for the chase<br/>
				I live for the chase<br/>
				I live for the chase<br/>
				I live for the chase</h3><br/>
