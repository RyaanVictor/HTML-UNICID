					<h3>You used to get it in your fishnets</br>
					Now you only get it in your night dress</br>
					Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness</br>
					Landed in a very common crisis</br>
					Everything's in order in a black hole</br>
					Nothing seems as pretty as the past, though</br>
					That Bloody Mary's lacking a Tabasco</br>
					Remember when you used to be a rascal?</br></br>

					Oh, that boy's a slag</br>
					The best you ever had</br>
					The best you ever had</br>
					Is just a memory and those dreams</br>
					Weren't as daft as they seemed</br>
					Not as daft as they seemed</br>
					My love, when you dreamed them up</br></br>

					Flicking through a little book of sex tips</br>
					Remember when the boys were all electric?</br>
					Now when she tells she's gonna get it</br>
					I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it</br>
					Clinging to not getting sentimental</br>
					Said she wasn't going but she went still</br>
					Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle</br>
					Was it a megadobber or a betting pencil?</br></br>

					Oh, that boy's a slag</br>
					The best you ever had</br>
					The best you ever had</br>
					Is just a memory and those dreams</br>
					But as daft as they seem</br>
					As daft as they seem</br>
					My love, when you dreamed them up</br></br>

					Oh, flo</br>
					Where did you go?</br>
					Where did you go?</br>
					Where did you go? Oh</br></br>

					Falling about</br>
					You took a left off Last Laugh Lane</br>
					Just sounding it out</br>
					But you're not coming back again</br></br>

					Youâ€™re falling about</br>
					You took a left off Last Laugh Lane</br>
					You were just sounding it out</br>
					But you're not coming back again</br></br>

					You used to get it in your fishnets</br>
					Now you only get it in your night dress (falling about)</br>
					Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness (you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)</br>
					Landed in a very common crisis</br>
					Everything's in order in a black hole</br>
					Is anything as pretty as the past though (you were just sounding it out)</br>
					That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco (you're not coming back again)</br>
					Remember when you used to be a rascal? Oh</h3></br>
